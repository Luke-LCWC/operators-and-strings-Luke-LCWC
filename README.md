# Level4-Lesson1

## Task 1

Update the code for task 1 so that the result of the operation is false, not true.

## Task 2

Alter the code so that the output is True, not False

## Task 3

Write code which asks a user to input their name and their age, and returns a messgae in the form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Hello, [name], you are [age] years old!_

## Task 4

Create a new, separate, Python file called _Survey.py_

This code is going to be a short user survey which asks the user their name, age and about their intersts (this is up to you) - it should be no longer than 10 questions total.

When the user has finished the program should print all their results to the screen in a clear and easy to read way, with suitable formatting. Ensure that the users age is stored as a number, not a string, in a variable called "age".
